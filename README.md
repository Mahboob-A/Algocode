<h3 align="center">General Information</h3>

Algocode is an online data structure and algorithm practice backend built in microservices architecture. 


*Algocode currently has three services*: <a href="https://github.com/Mahboob-A/algocode-auth">Algocode Auth Service .</a> <a href="https://github.com/Mahboob-A/code-manager">Code Manager Service .</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Mahboob-A/rcee/">RCE Engine Service</a>
<br/> <br/>

* <a href="https://github.com/Mahboob-A/algocode-auth">Algocode Auth Service </a> Auth Service handles user management.

* <a href="https://github.com/Mahboob-A/code-manager">Code Manager Service </a> Code Manager Service handles `code submission`, 
`code exec event creation to Message Queue`, and `saving and caching code executing result` to Database.

* <a href="https://github.com/Mahboob-A/rcee/">RCE Engine Service</a> RCE Engine Service contains the `C++` code execution Judge. 
The Judge is completely isolated and it is only accessible using `events`.  <br/>
Another RCE Engine service for `Java Judge`  and 'Python Judge` are under development. 
<br/> <br/>

The `C++ Judge` of <a href="https://github.com/Mahboob-A/rcee/">RCE Engine </a> can execute `C++`  codes and run test cases against the code output. It can currently  handle the below events: 

    a. AC (Accepted) 
    b. WA (Wrong Answer)
    c. Compilation Error 
    d. Time Limit Exceed 
    e. Memory Limit Exceed 
    f. Segmentation Fault

#### *NOTE* 

**A. The `C++ Judge` in *<a href="https://github.com/Mahboob-A/rcee/">RCE Engine </a>* is a pure docker implementation and no other 3rd party API or service has been used.**

> Please refer to the respective services to learn more about it. You will find rich and detailed documentation in the respective service's github repository, I promise!  

**B. Rate Limit Alert**

> The API endpoint to submit solution to the Algocode platfrom (API in <a href="https://github.com/Mahboob-A/code-manager">Code Manager Service </a>) is rate limited to `1 request per 20 seconds`. 
>> ```http 
>>     POST https://codemanager.algocode.site/api/v1/code/submit/
>> ``` 
> 
>> You can learn more on this in the `API Guideline - Code Submission in Algocode` section.

**C. Documentation**

> All the services has dedicated documentation page. Please visit the respective service repository to learn more.

<summary><h3 align="center">Architecture and Workflow</h3></summary>

#### Architecture of Algocode 

![image](https://github.com/Mahboob-A/algocode/assets/109282492/72ad2d8a-f664-450e-9b0a-8fd5d25d4c9c)

##### Algocode Services 

The Algocode platform is comprised of 3 services. 
<br/>
<a href="https://github.com/Mahboob-A/algocode-auth">Algocode Auth Service</a> For user management.   
<a href="https://github.com/Mahboob-A/code-manager">Code Manager Service</a> For interacting with client, data processing and event creation for RCE Engine.  
<a href="https://github.com/Mahboob-A/rcee/">RCE Engine Service</a> For executing the code submitted by the user and produce result for Code Manager Service to consume. 
<br/>

> The mentioned RCE Engine is responsible to execute `C++` code. The RCE Engine for `Java` and `Python` is under development. 

<br/>
<br/>

##### Workflow of Algocode - The Workflow below is Sequential How Algocode Works (See the Diagram)

**A. <a href="https://github.com/Mahboob-A/algocode-auth">Algocode Auth Service</a>** 

- The access to the Algocode begins from the Auth Service. 

- Algocode Auth Service is responsible for user management. 

- The user creates an account or logs in into the Algocode platform to complete the authentication/authorization process. 

- `PostgreSQL` database is used for user management. The database is `self-hosted` and capable of `backup` and `restore` data periodically. 

<br/>

**B. <a href="https://github.com/Mahboob-A/code-manager">Code Manager Service</a>**

- The Code Manager service is the true manager which is responsible to interact with users to submit the code submission request and return them the answer of their solution. 

- The user sends a `POST` request to the 

``` http
    POST https://codemanager.algocode.site/api/v1/code/submit/
``` 
API to submit their code solution. 

- Code Manager verifies the `authenticity of the user`, `processes the submitted data`, `publishes the data in a RabbbitMQ instance` and the `queue` is based on the `programming language` the solution is written, and returns a `submission_id` to the client. 
 
- Code Manager also listens to event produced by RCE Engine. The `RCE Engine executes the solution and publishes the result to an unified result queue`. 

- Once message is consumed by Code Manager from `result queue`, Code Manager `caches the result in Redis` and stores the result in `MongoDB database.`

- The client can send a `GET` request to the  `result check` 

```http
    GET  https://codemanager.algocode.site/api/v1/result/check/<submission_id>/
```

API to get the code execution result. The API is a `short polling request for 5 seconds`. 

- The `GET` request checks the `cache` first for the result, then `checks in database` and if the result is still not found, then the API process waits for `5 seconds` for availability of the data.

- If the data is available within the`5 seconds` wait time, it returns the result, otherwise, the below response will be returned. 

> | Response Key | Type     | Value/Description          |
> | :-------- | :------- | :------------------------- |
> | `status`    | `string` | `pending`  |
> | `data`    | `string` |  `null`    |

<br/>

**C. <a href="https://github.com/Mahboob-A/rcee/">RCE Engine Service</a>**

- The RCE Engine comprises either `C++ Judge`, or `Java Judge`, or `Python Judge`. 

- The RCE Engine consumes messages from respective `queue`. Each RCE Engine consumes `data` based on the `programming language` queue type i.e. RCE Engine for `C++ Judge` consumes data from `C++  queue`. 

- The RCE Engine `processes the consumed data`, `prepares the data for execution` and passes the data to the `Judge`. 

- The `Judge` creates a `secure` and `unprivileged` docker container to run the user submitted code. 

- The `Judge` stores the output of the code in a file after the `code execution` is completed.

- Once the `code execution` by the `Judge` is completed, the RCE Engine `compares the output with testcases`. 

- After the `output comparison with testcases`, the RCE Engine formats the `result data` and `publish the result data` to an unified `result queue` in a `RabbitMQ` instance which is consumed by `Code Manager Service`. 

- In case, you want to learn more about the `Judge Engine`, please check <a href="https://github.com/Mahboob-A/online-judge/">Online Judge</a> - a light-weight solution to test the Judge locally.

###  Registration in the Algocode Platform

> The <a href="https://github.com/Mahboob-A/algocode-auth">Algocode Auth Service </a> is handling the user management. 
> 
> To Know more about the `Algocode Auth Service` please visit the repository. 

You have two ways to submit a solution to the `Algocode` platform. You can create your own account, or you can use the `already available verified  account`.  

<br/>

#### A. By Using Ready to Use Account Details 

Please copy the account details and the login endpoint. 

```http
  POST https://auth.algocode.site/api/v1/auth/login/
```

| Parameter | Type     | Value                |

<br/>

###### b. Check Email for Token 

At this time please check your email, you will have received an email from `auth.algocode.site` domain. 

The email will have  an email validation URL to validate your account activation. *Do not click the URL*

As Algocode does not have any frontend, you need to verify the account manually. 

`Example Token URL`: 

```
To confirm this is correct, go to https://auth.algocode.site/api/v1/auth/registration/account-confirm-email/Mw:1sFEOr:xsqvnifUV5ppDFqbQBrmp2sIXGoRY63BmnFddsYTau4/
```

Copy everything after the account validation URL endpoint i.e. `https://auth.algocode.site/api/v1/auth/registration/account-confirm-email/` 

For the above example, copy `Mw:1sFEOr:xsqvnifUV5ppDFqbQBrmp2sIXGoRY63BmnFddsYTau4`. 

<br/>

Send a `POST` request to the below endpoint to validate your account creation. 

```http
    POST  https://auth.algocode.site/api/v1/auth/registration/verify-email/

```

| Parameter | Type     |  Value                |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------------------- |
| `key`    | `string` | **Required**. Your copied token from your email  |

***Response***

| Response Key | Type     |        Value            |        Description        | 
| :-------- | :------- | :------------------------- |:------------------------- | 
| `detail`    | `string` |  `OK`                     | Registration is successful!|
| `detail`    | `string` |   Any value other than `OK` | Registration is unsuccessful. Check the token again.|

<br/>

If you have received the response as `ok`, congratulation on creating your account on Algocode! 

You can now login to your account with the `login endpoint` mentioned above to get `access token` and 

head on to the `API Guideline - Code Submission in Algocode` section below.

<br/>

### Code Submission in Algocode 

<br/>

> The <a href="https://github.com/Mahboob-A/code-manager">Code Manager Service </a> is handling all the activities mentioned in this section. 
> 
>> To Know more about the `Algocode Code Manager Service` please visit the repository. 

<br/>
<br/>

Please follow the below steps to submit a solution in Algocode. 

> ##### Please Note - Rate Limit Alert    
> 
> -  **The `/api/v1/code/submit/` API endpoint to submit code solutions is `Rate Limited`.**
> 
>> The API endpoint is rate limited with `one request per 20 seconds` i.e. `3 requests per minute`. 
> 
> -  Did you ask why?
> 
>> Well, I am using the free `AWS` and `Azure` servers with only `1GB` of RAM! Hence I have no choice but to `Rate Limit` the API. 
> 
> -  I have implemented the `Rate Limit` using `Token Bucket Algorithm` and I have applied the Rate Limiter class *Project Wide for the quoted API* using `Middleware in Django`. 
> 
> - <a href="https://github.com/Mahboob-A/code-manager/blob/main/src/core_apps/code_submit/RateLimitMiddleware.py">Click Here</a> to see the implementation of the `Rate Limiter Class`. 

<br/>

##### Step 01

Write your solution for the problem you have chosen in `C++`, as currently `C++` is supported. Now, you have to convert it into `JSON` format. As the Algocode does not have client till now, to share data to the backend services, you need to convert it into `JSON`. 
You can simply make use of `ChatGPT` or `Gemini` for this task. You can share the code to `ChatGPT` or `Gemini` and ask it to convert it into `JSON`. That's it! 

##### Step 02 

As you have copied the `access token` as per the `API Guideline - Registration in Algocode` section, please paste the `access token` in `Bearer Token` option in `Auth` section in Postman or Insomnia. 

<br/>

Now, you are ready to submit the solution to the Algocode platform. Please send a `POST` request to the below API following the API reference.

<br/> 

```http
    POST https://codemanager.algocode.site/api/v1/code/submit/
```

| Parameter | Type     | Value/Description                |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------------------- |
| `problem_id`    | `string` | **Required**. The `problem_id` of the problem you are submitting the solution. |
| `lang` | `string` | **Required**. `cpp`. Currently `cpp` is supported. `java` RCE Engine is under development. |
| `code`    | `string` | **Required**. Your solution for the problem in `JSON` format.|

<br/> 

##### Example Payload 

Here's an example payload for one of a problem in Algocode `Sqrt(X)`. The problem is same as this <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/">Leetcode Problem.</a>

<br/> 

`Example Payload`

```

    "code": "#include <iostream>\n\nint mySqrt(int x) {\n    if (x == 0) return 0;\n    int left = 1, right = x, result = 0;\n    while (left <= right) {\n        
     int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;\n        if (mid <= x / mid) {\n            result = mid;\n            left = mid + 1;\n        } else {\n            right = mid - 1;\n        }\n    
    }\n    return result;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int t;\n    std::cin >> t;\n    while (t--) {\n        int x;\n        std::cin >> x;\n        std::cout << mySqrt(x) << 
    std::endl;\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n"
}
``` 
<br/>

#### The Backstage  

The project itself was a challenge for me! 

Once one of my mentors told me 

> Do the hard things while you are learning, so that the implementation becomes easier for you. 

I completely agree with this statement. I enjoy dealing with complex stuff, and `bugs` give me the `kick` I enjoy! 

Well, enough praise of myself. 

But I was not lying. When I thought to build the project 2 months ago (it took 1.5 months to wrap up the project, two weeks was idle). 
I had  zero knowledge whether I would be able to do it, but I had confidence that `somehow` I would do it. 
My thought process was simple -  "I do  not know `exactly how`, but I would do it `somehow` for sure!" 

And I am writing this `Readme` today  that I have completed the project, and `somehow` I have made it! That's my motivation. 

I know something is not simple as it sounds, but I know, `somehow I would manage it!` 

#### Challenges 

* The initial challenge was the design. Designing a  complex project like `Online Judge` in `microservices` to build from `scratch` was not easy as it sounds. 

 * The communication between microservices were fun discovery. I was searching for optimal solution and I learnt `RabbitMQ` for this cause, and I ended up writing a nice blog on `RabbitMQ 101`. Read <a href="https://imehboob.medium.com/message-queue-101-your-ultimate-guide-to-understand-message-queue-b2256961ab01">RabbitMQ 101 Here</a>. The Algocode platform is using an RabbitMQ instance from CloudAMQP platform. 

* Building a Online Judge from scratch was the hardest part to accomplish. At times, I though to abandon the idea of building the online Judge from scratch and use 3rd party APIs, but my instinct did not allow it! 

* However, after countless hours of debugging and reading internals of `docker networking`, `docker volume`, `docker containers`, `docker pyhton sdk`, `docker in docker` and `sibling docker`, `security in docker`, `linux internals` - I have explored countless number of internals and fixed hundred of bugs that taught me a lot. This resulted an Online Judge built from scratch using `docker`.  I have learnt so many new concepts while building the project `just proper by googling!`.  

* The next struggle was the `production build` for the project. I had to shift from `development` build to `production build` and eventually to deploy the project in `AWS` and `Azure` servers. 

* AWS closed my two new account to deploy the project, but after countless of emailing the `aws support`, they activated my account and finally I could deploy my project. 

* To wrap up, the entire project was a challenge for me: `The  design stage to research stage`, `to development stage to production stage to deployment stage` - I had to repeat all these steps with all the 3 (currently) services behind the Algocode platform. 


#### Learnings

* I have gained practical experience with `RabbitMQ` building this project. 

* I have gained deep knowledge on `docker`, `docker volumes`, `docker networking`, `Lunux internals` and many more.

* As the project is heavily dealing with files, I have gained valuable experience with `file handling` with `python`. 

* As I have built the project from `research`, `design`, `dev`, `production` to `deployment`, I have gained invaluable knowledge on design, development, production and deploy the project in `cloud services` like `AWS` or `Azure`. 

* As the project is in `microservises architecture`, I have gained practical knowledge on `communication`, `networking`,  between all other services; experience with cloud providers such a `AWS`, `Azure`  and onverall `dev to production` of a `SDLC`.
