<h3 align="center">General Information</h3>

Algocode is an online data structure and algorithm practice backend built in microservices architecture. 


*Algocode currently has three services*: <a href="https://github.com/Mahboob-A/algocode-auth">Algocode Auth Service .</a> <a href="https://github.com/Mahboob-A/code-manager">Code Manager Service .</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Mahboob-A/rcee/">RCE Engine Service</a>
<br/> <br/>
Another service for Java code execution is under development. 

The <a href="https://github.com/Mahboob-A/rcee/">RCE Engine </a> of Algocode can execute user codes and run test cases against the code output. 

The Online Judge of <a href="https://github.com/Mahboob-A/rcee/">RCE Engine </a> service can handle the below events: 

    a. AC (Accepted) 
    b. WA (Wrong Answer)
    c. Compilation Error 
    d. Time Limit Exceed 
    e. Memory Limit Exceed 
    f. Segmentation Fault

**The Online Judge used in *<a href="https://github.com/Mahboob-A/rcee/">RCE Engine </a>* is a pure docker implementation and no other 3rd party API or service has been used.**

> Please refer to the respective services to learn more about them. You will find rich and detailed documentation in the respective service's github repository, I promise!  <br/>
<br/>
<h3 align="center">Deployment</h3>

#### Small Note

> As of today I have build the backend in microservices, there's no frontend for the project. I am fully focusing on the advanced backend engineering, hence, if you want to contribute or want to build a frontend for the project, please do not hesitate to email me here:

#### Problem Lists in Algocode 

I have prepared a Notion Page for all the problems currently available in the Algocode project. Please visit this link <a href="https://github.com/Mahboob-A/rcee/">Update Me with a notion page link</a> to get the information. <br/> <br/> 
You will need to visit this page in order to submit your solution. Just read the problem statements, understand the problem, and copy the `problem id`. That's all you need to submit a solution! <br/><br/>
 Please read below for detailed guide on how to submit a solution in the *Algocode* platform.
